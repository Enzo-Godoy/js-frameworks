# js-frameworks
The idea it's to put some kind of information as tutorial per each framework folder. 

I would like to work on the next frameworks : 


AngulaJS(Yes, AngulaJS v1).
Angular 5-8.
React
Vue.js 


I would like to incorporate information about test in these framework. 
Unit, e2e. 
Potractor, karma, Jasmine. 
We will see how it goes. 

Feel free to suggest any improvement or add information.
